<p>This class, as the introduction, gave us a quick synopsis of the
field. The E-literature stuff (from Hayles) was really interesting,
particularly in terms of the long history of experimentation and
play that mark digital literary studies. Of particular interest,
too, was the boundary between critic and creator in the production
of E-Lit.</p>
<h2 id="may-24">May 24</h2>
<p>Prompt: Why would you create or want to provide a scholarly
reading edition? Why would you use markdown?</p>
<p>MC: If we’re thinking about a minimalist aesthetics, it
foregrounds the meaning of text--but of course the aesthetics of
the “original” text has meaning already. This is the
<em>design</em> part of minimalism, but in terms of the functional,
computing aspects of minimalism, then the big thing is
accessibility. Small file-sizes, for example. But why would we do a
minimalist edition of something like David Copperfield or War in
Peace...do people want that?</p>
<p>JT: I think people would, especially those who don’t have access
to the scholarly editions published by Norton, etc.</p>
<p>MC: Is access a problem for canonical texts like the above? One
can go into a library</p>
<p>JT: Or purchase a $1 edition of the texts.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>JT: My hesitation with minimal editions is this: why do we have
to sacrifice editorial nuance for access? Worries about the
pragmatics of the labour of marking up: it does provide jobs for
students and offers a good pedagogical opportunity.</p>
<p>MC: Who is the audience for Ed?</p>
<p>And what about huge corpora?</p>
<h2 id="notes-from-class">Notes from class</h2>
<p>Alyssa: Annotations and other scholarly apparatus isn’t the most
accessible; operates as a textual gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Accessibility is a big focus.</p>
<p>Problem of labour and how do people get <em>paid</em> for
it?</p>
<p>JS: Why not have a layer?</p>
<p>** JT to ask projects: can we create plain-text versions of our
primary sources [or everything, I suppose]; easier for digesting
texts and doing text-analysis through tools like Voyant</p>
<p>Heavy industries: Reducing the agency of the reader; maximalist
software (Flash), but minimalist aesthetics; using Flash for
text</p>
<p>Expanded Cinema: integrates the audience into the work</p>
<p>What can people in DH learn from visual culture (or what is the
relationship between visual culture and DH?)</p>
<p>Building spaces for interaction; not interested in creating
“content” but media that can be interpreted by machines; producing
forms, not necessarily content; allows for the free-play of the
material</p>
<p>Galloway: diegetic and non-diegetic machine operations</p>
<p>LISP: Minimal syntax that encourages use.</p>
<p>Programming language as minimalist?</p>
<p>Voyant: The use of the “Reveal” button; delegate responsibility
of hermeneutics to the computer</p>
<h3 id="interface-workshop">Interface Workshop</h3>
<p>Task: Use a mockup tool to design three interfaces for the same
minimalist poem, short fiction, or game of your choice.</p>
<p>Our poem: Shakespeare's Sonnet 73. This sonnet is about time and
memory, and the last two lines are reflective on the rest of the
poem.</p>
<p>Interface 1: Time We spread the fourteen lines of the sonnet out
vertically at increasing distances, so that a reader would need to
scroll to continue reading. Eventually, the reader would experience
long stretches of blank screen before arriving at the next line.
Thus, time breaks are imposed on the reading experience.</p>
<p>Interface 2: Space We separated the last two lines of the sonnet
from the rest of the poem, so that the reader would need to scroll
down to read the last two lines, at which point the first twelve
lines would no longer be visible. Thus, the experience of reading
the last two lines of the poem would be accompanied by the memory
of the earlier parts of the poem, without the benefit of the lines
themselves.</p>
<p>Interface 3: Annotation We embedded annotations in the text
itself, so that the annotations are stylistically indistinguishable
from the poem.</p>
<p>Interrogating the relationship between interface and content;
what is the function of the text?</p>
<p>One more interface per text: choose your own interface/framework
Think about content and interface relations Function (functional
minimalism) Actual wireframe to show</p>
<h2 id="may-25">May 25</h2>
<p>We keep coming back to the question of <em>audience</em> and the
deep forms of interaction that are enabled (but also disallowed) by
minimalism.</p>
<p>Michael and I noticed that our base assumption was that our
audience expected something useful. In other words, the audience
always already demands something productive when approaching
interfaces. Our interface was thus meant to trouble their normative
expectations by untethering the relationship between word and
meaning.</p>
<p>Of course, interfaces are not always useful for the audience, as
[[case study of the adblocker thing]] points out.</p>
<p>Workshop 3: Designing an exhibit</p>
<p>Select a collection of materials Identify a theme (or exhibit
title) for navigating the theme Select a space on campus Detail +
sketch: [tactile, digital, both?] Materials and their location
Descriptions and their location Curatorial decisions and their
location</p>
<p>Joy Kogawa stuff at UBC. Determining the proper stairs to put
the exhibit; the geography of the disciplines in Clearihue
Negotiation, interface What kind of experience are they supposed to
have?</p>
<p>Maps of BC in varying states going throughout the ceiling things
And then just small bits of text with explanatory materials
beside</p>
<p>IDEAS: Digital Photo Frame QR Code [commercialization?] Dead
drops</p>
<p>Workshop 2:</p>
<p>An edition faithful to temporality: A Temporary Memory
analepsis/prolepsis</p>
<p>One table of contents: The structural elements of the text
Grouped by original publication dates</p>
<p>TOC 2: Index of internal reference</p>
<p>Theme/trope: Meta-moments, p17, ‘I remember this blah…’</p>
<p>Workshop 1:</p>
<p>Scenario: You’re teaching and you make your texts accessible in
various formats. More important, you want to help your students
navigate themes in the novels. You want to give the opportunity for
the student to scan the text with those themes in mind. Design a
text so students can scan it with their eyes and their ears.</p>
<p>Wave validator: Investigating digital projects in dhcommons, but
also investigating MoEML: structural issues of no “alt-text.”</p>
<p>Scanning happens through structural or semantic data in a
website</p>
<p>Delineate in parts and make a linked TOC Separate the parts by
original publication dates Link the separate memories/associate the
memories</p>
<p>Case studies:</p>
<p>Wave--the API is expensive...but can it be integrated into a
process? What might it mean for Endings to integrate accessibility
as a core concern?</p>
<p>Questions/reflection on the accessible edition workshop: the
issue of value. Perhaps a paranoid critique, but how might
foregrounding accessibility offer the same sort of sacrificial work
that are worrying for minimal editions. In other words, what is
lost in presuming the need for types of access (or what kind of
hermeneutics/interpretations are we surfacing in creating these
editions that foreclose other interpretations, taxonomize,
etc?)</p>
<p>Recap:</p>
<p>What did we cut out of our interface? We cut out “reason” or a
type of legibility Word =/= meaning =/= action Assumptions? Most
about the “uselessness” of the interface: Our base assumption is
that the audience expects something useful; that interfaces are
normatively or dominantly useful; that there is an assumed relation
between the action word and the action itself. In sum: we made
assumptions that the audience would assume something; the audience
would be familiar with the genre The audience would understand The
audience would appreciate The audience would react The audience
would come to realize</p>
<h2 id="may-26">May 26</h2>
<p>Picking back up from yesterday. Questions of access--and the
everyday Thinking about context, embodiment, access, modalities
Tactile and lived experiences for audiences Navigation relies on
seeing, vision, movement, touch Designs in use, rather than design
in ideal How people use the space prior to installation Functional:
use and features; structural: engagement, habit</p>
<p>Visualization Workshop</p>
<p>Terms and classifications What are the kind of standards and
ontologies at work in the visualizations you see in a digital
project? Think through a concept model</p>
<p>Think of 5 relations 3 ways that you would visualize
‘edge-significance’ Example:
https://linkedjazz.org/ontology-building-for-linked-open-data-a-pragmatic-perspective/</p>
<p>Visualization is tied to quantitative graphical representation
Treating data is a resource; the points are tangible Johanna
Drucker and Gittleman: All data are cooked; there is no raw data.
And that all data (or capta) are produced Flatness--how to make it
more robust, and to think with it rather than consider it as proof
Data visualization as an art form What happens when you flatten
material so that people can navigate it? To what ends? “How do we
engage modularization, responsibility?”</p>
<p>Working with Python: how might responsibility be distributed
across modules, functions, etc? (Does Python distinguish between
public and private class like Java?)</p>
