<p>This class, as the introduction, gave us a quick synopsis of the field. The E-literature stuff (from Hayles) was really interesting, particularly in terms of the long history of experimentation and play that mark digital literary studies. Of particular interest, too, was the boundary between critic and creator in the production of E-Lit.</p>
<h2 id="may-24">May 24</h2>
<p>Prompt: Why would you create or want to provide a scholarly reading edition? Why would you use markdown?</p>
<p>MC: If we’re thinking about a minimalist aesthetics, it foregrounds the meaning of text--but of course the aesthetics of the “original” text has meaning already. This is the <em>design</em> part of minimalism, but in terms of the functional, computing aspects of minimalism, then the big thing is accessibility. Small file-sizes, for example. But why would we do a minimalist edition of something like David Copperfield or War in Peace...do people want that?</p>
<p>JT: I think people would, especially those who don’t have access to the scholarly editions published by Norton, etc.</p>
<p>MC: Is access a problem for canonical texts like the above? One can go into a library</p>
<p>JT: Or purchase a $1 edition of the texts.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>JT: My hesitation with minimal editions is this: why do we have to sacrifice editorial nuance for access? Worries about the pragmatics of the labour of marking up: it does provide jobs for students and offers a good pedagogical opportunity.</p>
<p>MC: Who is the audience for Ed?</p>
<p>And what about huge corpora?</p>
<h2 id="notes-from-class">Notes from class</h2>
<p>Alyssa: Annotations and other scholarly apparatus isn’t the most accessible; operates as a textual gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Accessibility is a big focus.</p>
<p>Problem of labour and how do people get <em>paid</em> for it?</p>
<p>JS: Why not have a layer?</p>
<p>** JT to ask projects: can we create plain-text versions of our primary sources [or everything, I suppose]; easier for digesting texts and doing text-analysis through tools like Voyant</p>
<p>Heavy industries: Reducing the agency of the reader; maximalist software (Flash), but minimalist aesthetics; using Flash for text</p>
<p>Expanded Cinema: integrates the audience into the work</p>
<p>What can people in DH learn from visual culture (or what is the relationship between visual culture and DH?)</p>
<p>Building spaces for interaction; not interested in creating “content” but media that can be interpreted by machines; producing forms, not necessarily content; allows for the free-play of the material</p>
<p>Galloway: diegetic and non-diegetic machine operations</p>
<p>LISP: Minimal syntax that encourages use.</p>
<p>Programming language as minimalist?</p>
<p>Voyant: The use of the “Reveal” button; delegate responsibility of hermeneutics to the computer</p>
<h3 id="interface-workshop">Interface Workshop</h3>
<p>Task: Use a mockup tool to design three interfaces for the same minimalist poem, short fiction, or game of your choice.</p>
<p>Our poem: Shakespeare's Sonnet 73. This sonnet is about time and memory, and the last two lines are reflective on the rest of the poem.</p>
<p>Interface 1: Time<br />
We spread the fourteen lines of the sonnet out vertically at increasing distances, so that a reader would need to scroll to continue reading. Eventually, the reader would experience long stretches of blank screen before arriving at the next line. Thus, time breaks are imposed on the reading experience.</p>
<p>Interface 2: Space<br />
We separated the last two lines of the sonnet from the rest of the poem, so that the reader would need to scroll down to read the last two lines, at which point the first twelve lines would no longer be visible. Thus, the experience of reading the last two lines of the poem would be accompanied by the memory of the earlier parts of the poem, without the benefit of the lines themselves.</p>
<p>Interface 3: Annotation<br />
We embedded annotations in the text itself, so that the annotations are stylistically indistinguishable from the poem.</p>
<p>Interrogating the relationship between interface and content; what is the function of the text?</p>
<p>One more interface per text: choose your own interface/framework<br />
Think about content and interface relations<br />
Function (functional minimalism)<br />
Actual wireframe to show</p>
<h2 id="may-25">May 25</h2>
<p>We keep coming back to the question of <em>audience</em> and the deep forms of interaction that are enabled (but also disallowed) by minimalism.</p>
<p>Michael and I noticed that our base assumption was that our audience expected something useful. In other words, the audience always already demands something productive when approaching interfaces. Our interface was thus meant to trouble their normative expectations by untethering the relationship between word and meaning.</p>
<p>Of course, interfaces are not always useful for the audience, as [[case study of the adblocker thing]] points out.</p>
<p>Workshop 3: Designing an exhibit</p>
<p>Select a collection of materials<br />
Identify a theme (or exhibit title) for navigating the theme<br />
Select a space on campus<br />
Detail + sketch: [tactile, digital, both?]<br />
Materials and their location<br />
Descriptions and their location<br />
Curatorial decisions and their location</p>
<p>Joy Kogawa stuff at UBC.<br />
Determining the proper stairs to put the exhibit; the geography of the disciplines in Clearihue<br />
Negotiation, interface<br />
What kind of experience are they supposed to have?</p>
<p>Maps of BC in varying states going throughout the ceiling things<br />
And then just small bits of text with explanatory materials beside</p>
<p>IDEAS:<br />
Digital Photo Frame<br />
QR Code [commercialization?]<br />
Dead drops</p>
<p>Workshop 2:</p>
<p>An edition faithful to temporality: A Temporary Memory analepsis/prolepsis</p>
<p>One table of contents:<br />
The structural elements of the text<br />
Grouped by original publication dates</p>
<p>TOC 2:<br />
Index of internal reference</p>
<p>Theme/trope:<br />
Meta-moments, p17, ‘I remember this blah…’</p>
<p>Workshop 1:</p>
<p>Scenario: You’re teaching and you make your texts accessible in various formats. More important, you want to help your students navigate themes in the novels. You want to give the opportunity for the student to scan the text with those themes in mind. Design a text so students can scan it with their eyes and their ears.</p>
<p>Wave validator: Investigating digital projects in dhcommons, but also investigating MoEML: structural issues of no “alt-text.”</p>
<p>Scanning happens through structural or semantic data in a website</p>
<p>Delineate in parts and make a linked TOC<br />
Separate the parts by original publication dates<br />
Link the separate memories/associate the memories</p>
<p>Case studies:</p>
<p>Wave--the API is expensive...but can it be integrated into a process? What might it mean for Endings to integrate accessibility as a core concern?</p>
<p>Questions/reflection on the accessible edition workshop: the issue of value. Perhaps a paranoid critique, but how might foregrounding accessibility offer the same sort of sacrificial work that are worrying for minimal editions. In other words, what is lost in presuming the need for types of access (or what kind of hermeneutics/interpretations are we surfacing in creating these editions that foreclose other interpretations, taxonomize, etc?)</p>
<p>Recap:</p>
<p>What did we cut out of our interface?<br />
We cut out “reason” or a type of legibility<br />
Word =/= meaning =/= action<br />
Assumptions? Most about the “uselessness” of the interface:<br />
Our base assumption is that the audience expects something useful; that interfaces are normatively or dominantly useful; that there is an assumed relation between the action word and the action itself. In sum: we made assumptions that the audience would assume something; the audience would be familiar with the genre<br />
The audience would understand<br />
The audience would appreciate<br />
The audience would react<br />
The audience would come to realize</p>
<h2 id="may-26">May 26</h2>
<p>Picking back up from yesterday.<br />
Questions of access--and the everyday<br />
Thinking about context, embodiment, access, modalities<br />
Tactile and lived experiences for audiences<br />
Navigation relies on seeing, vision, movement, touch<br />
Designs in use, rather than design in ideal<br />
How people use the space prior to installation<br />
Functional: use and features; structural: engagement, habit</p>
<p>Visualization Workshop</p>
<p>Terms and classifications<br />
What are the kind of standards and ontologies at work in the visualizations you see in a digital project?<br />
Think through a concept model</p>
<p>Think of 5 relations<br />
3 ways that you would visualize ‘edge-significance’<br />
Example: <a href="https://linkedjazz.org/ontology-building-for-linked-open-data-a-pragmatic-perspective/" class="uri">https://linkedjazz.org/ontology-building-for-linked-open-data-a-pragmatic-perspective/</a></p>
<p>Visualization is tied to quantitative graphical representation<br />
Treating data is a resource; the points are tangible<br />
Johanna Drucker and Gittleman: All data are cooked; there is no raw data. And that all data (or capta) are produced<br />
Flatness--how to make it more robust, and to think with it rather than consider it as proof<br />
Data visualization as an art form<br />
What happens when you flatten material so that people can navigate it? To what ends?<br />
“How do we engage modularization, responsibility?”</p>
<p>Working with Python: how might responsibility be distributed across modules, functions, etc? (Does Python distinguish between public and private class like Java?)</p>

<h3 id="working-design-brief">Working Design Brief</h3>
<p><strong>Working title</strong>:<br />
The Public TRC</p>
<p><strong>Tagline</strong>:<br />
???</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>:<br />
A digital edition / a toolset for doing similar work</p>
<p><strong>Concept/function</strong>:<br />
To have a minimal but rigorously encoded version of the TRC for preservation in archives as well as text analysis work; hopefully, this could be forked on GitHub so that people could create similarly made minimal editions.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
Creating an accessible version of the TRC with companion TEI and TXT files.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>:<br />
So that the TRC can be &quot;unlocked&quot; from its PDF form; be edited and preserved in a language that outlasts PDF (and is smaller); is subject to critique through text analysis tools; can be owned and distributed, rethought, and worked with by others. (Explanation not necessary but: right now, most of the TRC documents are either in print OR hosted by a for-profit web design company called &quot;My Robust.&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>Domain</strong>:<br />
Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>Structure</strong>:<br />
A website on GitHub with a build/distribution</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong>:<br />
My project's scope will feature the summary report, which contains survivor testimony, calls to action, and hisorical background (basically just a condensed version of the other reports).</p>
<p><strong>Recipe</strong>:<br />
Build process that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splits PDFs,</li>
<li>Turns it into PNGs</li>
<li>Uses tesseract (open-source) to create HOCR (near HTML files of the PDFs)</li>
<li>Use a conversion from HOCR --&gt; TEI</li>
<li>Edit the TEI and do some light encoding that will be necessary for this to be a rich text</li>
<li>Create a version of the TRC that is</li>
<li>Readable, scannable, searchable, &quot;minable&quot;, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aesthetic</strong>:<br />
&quot;Ed&quot;-esque, but without Jekyll. Pure TEI --&gt; HTML using XSLT (and maybe some BASH scripting)</p>
<p><strong>Biases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>That people want this</li>
<li>That PDFs are not incredibly sustainable, easily corruptable, design oriented rather than textually significant</li>
<li>This is thus a slight critique of design <em>for design's sake</em> rather than the relationship between design and function</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Influences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital editing projects, as well as Ed...but in critique of Ed as the necessity for simplicity</li>
<li>The larger sort of /dist/ here is that the code can be forked to be used for any multipage PDFs to turn into TEI and then accessible HTML. The problem, however, is that it will necessarily need to be customizable.</li>
