This class, as the introduction, gave us a quick synopsis of the field. The E-literature stuff (from Hayles) was really interesting, particularly in terms of the long history of experimentation and play that mark digital literary studies. Of particular interest, too, was the boundary between critic and creator in the production of E-Lit.

We keep coming back to the question of *audience* and the deep forms of interaction that are enabled (but also disallowed) by minimalism.

Michael and I noticed that our base assumption was that our audience expected something useful. In other words, the audience always already demands something productive when approaching interfaces. Our interface was thus meant to trouble their normative expectations by untethering the relationship between word and meaning.

Of course, interfaces are not always useful for the audience, as [[case study of the adblocker thing]] points out.
