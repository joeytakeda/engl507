<p>Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store, &gt; Though foolishly he lost the same, &gt;&gt; Decaying more and more, &gt;&gt;&gt; Till he became &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most poore: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With thee &gt;&gt;&gt; O let me rise &gt;&gt; As larks, harmoniously, &gt; And sing this day thy victories: Then shall the fall further the flight in me.</p>
<p>My tender age in sorrow did beginne &gt; And still with sicknesses and shame. &gt;&gt; Thou didst so punish sinne, &gt;&gt;&gt; That I became &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most thinne. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With thee &gt;&gt;&gt; Let me combine, &gt;&gt; And feel thy victorie: &gt; For, if I imp my wing on thine, Affliction shall advance the flight in me.</p>
